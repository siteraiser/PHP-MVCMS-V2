To develop an mvc application to be indexed in the site search you have 2 options. The sitemap can be adjusted within the sitemap controllers, models and views.

1. Use the page table and supply an articleid and article with content and type(headline will be the title in the site search, content- searchable exact matches currently highlighed in results). In this case the sitemap and search can be used (.0 priority can be used to remove item from the sitemap).  

2. Use an article only. Columns required are: articlename, published, type and content columns.

Site Raiser fully customizable mvc-cms features:
1. CKEditor for articles which can be aggregated into single or separate views.
2. Drag and drop nested menu managment system for mutliple menus.
3. Templates as views enables safe custom php execution and customizable per page templates from within the page editor.
4. Each template can have a loadable model to perform per template processing for automatic image, video or html customization.
5. Fully automatic front and back end caching system for the cms.
6. Powerful reverse index search class which is easily interfaced with using the articles table for your custom mvc programs. If you choose to use pages and articles, the system sitemap generator can also be used. 
7. Category / link manager for creating manageable sections using seo friendly urls (auto renaming of subcategories on edit, also linked to the pages)
8. Easy routing access to make url planning a sinch.
9. All system pages can be published and unpublished from the sitemap, the site search and general access.
10. Tested with bootstrap and material design frontend frameworks.
